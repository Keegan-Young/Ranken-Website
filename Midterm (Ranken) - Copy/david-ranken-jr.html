            <h2>David Ranken, Jr.</h2>

            <p>
                David Ranken, Jr., was born at Boystown, County Londonderry, Ireland, October 9, 1835. 
                He was the son of David and Ann Ranken of old Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestry which had 
                emigrated from Scotland to the north of Ireland several centuries ago and engaged in the 
                linen industry, in which they were highly prosperous. He was educated in Belfast Academy, 
                Belfast, Ireland. His mother’s last surviving brother, David Ranken, who had come to this 
                country in 1816, died a bachelor in St. Louis in 1859, leaving a large estate which was 
                inherited by the families of his two deceased brothers, Thomas and John and his two sisters, 
                Mrs. Mary (Ranken) Patton and Mrs. Ann (Ranken) Ranken, mother of David, Jr. David Ranken, Jr., 
                came to St. Louis in 1862 at the age of twenty-five to assume charge of this large estate of his uncle 
                and he continued to reside here during the remainder of his life. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                He never married but lived a quiet 
                and simple life, devoting his energies to the care of his real estate and financial interests. He was 
                not, however, indifferent to civic affairs. In 1870 he was elected a director of the Missouri Pacific 
                Railroad, which was afterward sold to Jay Gould. He was a director in the Louisiana Purchase 
                Exposition and a member of the St. Louis Business Men’s League. He devoted much attention to 
                railroad se rarities. His judgment in these matters was excellent, and he was eminently successful 
                in his investments.

                <br>
                <br>

                He was quiet and simple in his habits, of inflexible will and absolute integrity. He was dignified, 
                courteous and reserved, an exemplification of the old school gentleman. In his younger days he was 
                often present at social functions but cared little for society. In his later days he was of slender 
                frame, slightly stooped, hair whitened by age, strong features and piercing eyes, a keen observer, 
                slow to make friends, of abstemious habits, diligent in business, walking the streets with alert step, 
                observant of all that went on. He never cared for notoriety even after his benefactions had become 
                public.

                <br>
                <br>
                    
                Finally, after months, almost years, of investigation and thought, he formed the idea of establishing 
                an institution wherein should be taught the useful and necessary mechanical trades, the purpose of 
                which should not be higher education but the development of the most perfect skill in workmanship 
                and the inculcation of respect for the dignity of labor. This idea of founding a school for the 
                teaching of mechanical trades was doubtless suggested to him by lion.

                <br>
                <br>
                
                Rolla Wells, then mayor of 
                the city of St. Louis. Mr. Ranken visited institutions of this kind in the east, and finally the 
                idea culminated in the establishment of the David Ranken, Jr., School of Mechanical Trades. He did 
                not want to wait until his death to carry this plan into execution but by a foundation deed, 
                prepared after months of careful consideration, he established the school with a munificent gift of 
                more than a million dollars, to which later, in July, 1910, he added practically his entire fortune.


                <br>
                <br>

                The school has been very successful from the start and has increased its enrollment In the 
                eleven years of its operation until in the year 1919-1920 It gave instruction to four hundred 
                and fifty-eight students in the day school and one thousand one hundred eighty-four students in 
                the evening school. It has become widely known for the efficiency of its instruction, and its 
                graduates are fulfilling the hope of Mr. Ranken that they might “earn good wages and be fitted 
                for positions of responsibility in the trades.”
