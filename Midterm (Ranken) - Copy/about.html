            <h2>What is Ranken?</h2>

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.ranken.edu" target="_blank">Ranken</a> 
                is a technical college based out of Missouri, there are 3 campuses, St. Louis,
                Missouri, Perryville, Missouri and Wentzville, Missouri. Ranken Technical College was 
                founded in 1907 by David Ranken, Jr., as a private, non-profit educational institution 
                to train students for employment in a variety of technical and mechanical occupations. 
                Established with a foundation deed of more than $1 million, Ranken began its first 
                academic year in September 1909. David Ranken later added his entire fortune to the 
                school's endowment, which, since then, has contributed to the substantial growth of 
                the college and helped to reduce annual operating costs and tuition.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ranken offers programs in five main divisions: Automotive, Electrical, Construction, 
                Information Technology, and Manufacturing. The school has a student body consisting of 
                approximately 2,300 men and women. In the fall of 2008, Ranken College completed Walker 
                Hall. Walker Hall is the first student housing building and accommodates over 200 on-campus 
                residents.
                <br>
                <br>
                At Ranken Technical College, we know that the best way to prepare students for success in 
                the real world is to begin treating them as professionals from day one. For each hour of 
                classroom instruction, our students spend at least three hours in a lab or shop setting, 
                becoming proficient in the skills they need to excel in their careers. This means that 
                each student spends an average of 15 hours a week doing hands-on work with the guidance of 
                our expert instructors. With this extensive practical experience, Ranken graduates are highly
                trained and fully equipped for successful careers.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, recent renovations to the Rodenheiser Automotive Center give students in our 
                growing Automotive Division access to our unparalleled tools and equipment in up-to-date 
                shops. At Ranken, we prepare students for professional success by giving them hands-on 
                experience in professional facilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside the St. Louis metro area, our new Ranken Wentzville location continues the 
                College’s tradition of excellence with its state-of-the art shops, labs and equipment. 
                In its first year of operation, Ranken Wentzville has already surpassed the College’s 
                five-year enrollment goals for the location. Because of this exceptional rate of growth, 
                Ranken Wentzville is currently expanding its facilities in order to serve more students in 
                he area. This growing location will offer new courses and will continue to provide the gold 
                standard in hands-on technical education to even more students.
