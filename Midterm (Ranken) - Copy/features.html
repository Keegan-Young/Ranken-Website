            <h2 class="feat_h2">Why should you choose Ranken?</h2>

            <p class="features">
                    Too many students graduate from college with big debt, and then struggle to find a job 
                    doing what they spent all that time and money studying.
                    Career and technical education is different. Graduates from high-quality technical 
                    colleges don’t struggle to find jobs in their fields – they’re in high demand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are currently more job openings than workers in most technical careers, and 
                    employers recognize the importance of technical education in training the workforce they 
                    need.
                    When employers have to compete for skilled talent, there are huge benefits for technical 
                    college graduates:

                    <ul class="features">
                        <li>Higher starting salaries</li>
                        <li>More job opportunities to pick from</li>
                        <li>Less lag time from graduation to employment</li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="features">
                    At Ranken, you don’t just graduate with an education – you graduate ready to work.
